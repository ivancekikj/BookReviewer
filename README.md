# Introduction

Book Reviewer is a web application meant for what its very name stands for. It supports 3 types of users: anonymous, normal users and administrators. All 3 types can view the available books and reviews. Normal users can also leave a review on each book and even recommend a new book. As for administrators, they: have the ability to approve recommended books; can manage the information related to books, authors and publishers; and can approve new admins to log in.
